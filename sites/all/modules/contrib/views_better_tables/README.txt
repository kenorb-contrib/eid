Better Views Tables
===================

Overview
--------
Better Views Tables is an extension module to the existing tables integration in Views. It updates some of the markup to the updates to the table element in HTML5.

It also adds support for some extension modules to work with tables. The [Visualize](http://drupal.org/project/visualize) module allows tables to be rendered as charts and graphs. The [Responsive Tables](http://drupal.org/sandbox/aptorian/1793634) module allows your table to grow/shrink as required by the device.

Installation
------------

Extract the module into your modules directory (ex: sites/all/modules/contrib) and enable the module from the admin/modules page (or with *drush en bvt* from the command line).

Usage
-----

In Views, select your style plugin as "Better Views Tables" and configure your display.

Notes
-----

Ideally any updates to tables in this module would be great to see included in Views itself. The goal of this module is to allow for experimentation on tables in Views and potentially migrate the functionality into Views itself.
